  <h1>About Me</h1>

  <p>Hello, my name is Tim Hill and I am 26 years old. I work for UTC Aerospace Systems as an IT Business Partner which is allowing me to return to school to finish my degree. When not working, I love to spend time with my family and whenever I can, I love to travel/spend time in nature. With that said, I would like for you to meet my family in the picture below (Mila, Mommy, Madi and Me):</p>

  <p>I do have some experience with web programming but I still consider myself a beginner because I lack the fundamentals. I started back in 2013 with a course at my local community college and since then, I haven't really done much with it. I have audited tons of content using MOOCs and even managed to build a website using SquareSpace. But that requies almost zero programming. A few platforms, I like to use for web development are Freecodecamp.com and Udacity. The ultimate goal is to improve my skills so that I can start a web design business someday. </p>
