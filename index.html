        <h2>Welcome to My First Page</h2>

        <p>Hello and welcome to my first webpage for CPST 342. So far I am loving this course. It is by far my favorite out of all my courses for Fall 2. I've gone through each example in the book and I'm surprised at how much I know about HTML. I am really looking forward to learning JavaScript.  </p>

        <p> My expectations for this course is to learn and memorize as much of this stuff as possible. I've been playing around on the Google Dev page lately and noticed that I love design. Well, I actually love the thought of design. Hopefully, I can master these topics with the your help!</p>
